# Custom Terminal

I made my theme by combining the themes below with a little bit of my own twist using [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev).

Find a theme that has a structure you like and edit its file in `oh-my-posh/themes/{theme-name}.omp.json` after installing oh-my-posh (or create a new file for it). Also make sure to call that file's name in your `.bash_profile`.
